    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      It’s surprisingly simple to turn just milk and a spoonful of yogurt into a
      big batch of rich, creamy Instant Pot yogurt. The process is mostly
      hands-off: heat the milk, cool it, whisk in a bit of active-culture
      yogurt, and let the Instant Pot incubate it for several hours until it
      thickens and gently jiggles. After a chill in the fridge, it becomes
      smooth, tangy, and ready to eat. This homemade version costs far less than
      store-bought, and you can adjust the texture however you like—strain it
      for Greek-style thickness or leave it as is for a milder, looser yogurt.
      It keeps well for over a week and even provides its own starter for future
      batches.
