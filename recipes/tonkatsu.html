    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A Japanese dish of breaded and deep-fried pork cutlet.
      This version utilizes pork loin, and is typically served with
      shredded cabbage, cucumber, and tonkatsu sauce,
      which is a thick worcestershire-like sauce.
      It can be eaten on its own or used in other recipes
      like katsu curry or tonkatsu sandwiches.
      The key features are the crispy panku breadcrumb crust
      and the tender, juicy interior.
